IBM Data Analysis with Python Final Project
House Sales in King County, USA
IBM Data Analysis with Python Final Project:

This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Analysis with Python course on Coursera. It explores the King County housing dataset to uncover patterns affecting house prices and uses regression models to predict them.

Project Overview:

The notebook includes these main stages:

Data Cleaning: Removed extra columns and fixed missing data.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Used visualizations to study how features like size, bedrooms, and waterfront view impact price.

Feature Engineering: Applied polynomial transformations to capture non-linear relationships.

Model Development:

Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Polynomial Ridge Regression (degree = 2)

Model Evaluation-Measured accuracy using the R² score on test data.

Skills Used:

Data wrangling, visualization, regression modeling, and model evaluation using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Tools:

Jupyter Notebook

Python 3

IBM Skills Network Labs

Summary:

The Polynomial Ridge Regression (degree = 2) model achieved the best balance between bias and variance, providing improved accuracy in predicting housing prices.
